This beer does not offer an overly sweet impression, but rather a mild balance between malt sweetness, hop bitterness and light to moderate mouthfeel. A classic Münchner Dunkel should have chocolate-like, roast malt, bread-like or biscuit-like aroma that comes from the use of Munich dark malt. Chocolate or roast malts can be used, but the percentage used should be minimal. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Ale-like fruity esters and chill haze should not be perceived.",

If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

There is no aromatic hop added that might overpower the distinct spice scent.  The medium body of this beer is formed from caramel and pale malts.  These create enough body to support the spices without making the beer excessively rich.  Bittering hops are added to counter the sweetness of the malt and spice.  The finish of the beer is a blend of cinnamon and nutmeg.  The combination of these two spices results in a balanced, pumpkin-pie flavor. \r\n\r\nThe overall character is a smooth, medium bodied ale spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg.",

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn’t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",
